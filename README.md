This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML involving implicit type coercion in JavaScript. The bug.html file contains JavaScript code that attempts to add a number and a string, resulting in type coercion and an unexpected output. The bugSolution.html file provides a corrected version of the code, explicitly converting the string to a number before performing the addition.
